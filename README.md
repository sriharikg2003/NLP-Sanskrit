## Overview
Sanskrit, an ancient and classical language of India, holds significant cultural and religious importance. The Bhagavad Gita and Yoga Sutra are two essential texts in Sanskrit that contain profound philosophical insights and teachings. This NLP project aims to employ various ML techniques to gain a deeper understanding of these texts, uncovering patterns, and extracting meaningful information from them.

## Project Goals
- Apply NLP techniques to preprocess and clean the Sanskrit texts.
- Perform text analysis to identify recurring patterns, themes, and topics within the Bhagavad Gita and Yoga Sutra.
- Develop algorithms to extract key teachings and insights from the texts.
- Visualize the results to provide a clear and insightful representation of the findings.
